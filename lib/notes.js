/*
- Exports a constructor function
- Compose a prototype method that can execute the correct (any) operation, given the above object
- How will you use that object to run the correct method?
  - You can predict that add won’t be the only action we’re going to have to handle…
- Write a prototype method called add() that will create an object representing a note (with an ID and the note text as properties) and console.log the text of the note to be added when the add command is executed
